## Overview
This project involves querying and analyzing data from two databases: `md_water_services` and `united_nations`. The goal is to derive insights and make informed decisions based on the extracted information. The queries encompass various aspects, including employee data, water sources, service access, and regional statistics.
It aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing water quality and improving infrastructure in communities. Leveraging SQL scripts and data analysis techniques, the system integrates data from various sources to assess water sources, pollution levels, and community needs. By offering functionalities for filtering, analyzing, and visualizing data, decision-makers can identify areas requiring intervention, prioritize improvement projects, track project progress, and assess performance. Ultimately, this system aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to enhance water quality and accessibility, contributing to sustainable development goals.
This SQL script is a comprehensive set of queries and operations performed on databases related to water services and access to basic services. It includes operations such as data manipulation, analysis, and database management. Below is a summary of the key sections of the script:

## Technologies Used
- SQL

## Instructions
1. Connect to the respective databases (`md_water_services`, `united_nations`).
2. Execute the provided SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data.
3. Review the generated insights and draw conclusions for decision-making.

## Queries and Insights
### Water Services Database (`md_water_services`)
- **Employee Information**:
    - Generating new email addresses for employees.
    - Updating employee records with emails and standardized phone numbers.
- **Employee Distribution**:
    - Counting employees per town and identifying top-performing employees.
- **Location Statistics**:
    - Analyzing records per town, province, and location type.
- **Water Source Analysis**:
    - Investigating water sources, people served, and distribution percentages.
- **Ranking and Prioritization**:
    - Ranking water sources based on population served using various methods.

### United Nations Database (`united_nations`)
- **Access to Basic Services**:
    - Reviewing access to managed drinking water services.
    - Analyzing regional and sub-regional statistics, including GDP and country count.

## United Nations Database Operations
- **Basic Services Analysis**: Analyzes access to basic services data, including counts, percentages, and economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment rates.
- **Geographical Location and Economic Indicator Table Creation**: Creates separate tables for geographical location and economic indicators to reduce data redundancy and establish proper relationships.
- **Subqueries and Join Operations**: Demonstrates the use of subqueries and join operations for data analysis and filtering.
  
## Water Services Database Operations
- **Email and Phone Number Formatting**: Formats email addresses and trims unnecessary spaces from phone numbers in the employee table.
- **Employee and Visit Analysis**: Analyzes employee data including counting employees per city and visits per employee.
- **Location and Water Source Analysis**: Provides insights into location data such as record counts per town and province, as well as analysis of water sources including counts and percentages.
- **Employee Ranking**: Ranks employees based on their performance in water source surveys using various ranking functions.
- **Queue Analysis**: Utilizes datetime functions to analyze survey duration, most visited day of the week, and average time spent in queues during surveys.

## Additional Features
- **Data Type Conversion**: Demonstrates data type conversion functions such as CAST() and CONVERT().
- **String Manipulation**: Utilizes string manipulation functions for data cleaning and extraction.
- **Custom ID Generation**: Generates custom IDs for countries based on specified columns in the table.
- **Regional Classification**: Classifies African countries into regional economic communities and performs analysis based on this classification.
- **Subquery Operations**: Utilizes subqueries for data filtering and analysis, both with JOIN and FROM keywords.

### Script README for the third script of this project.

This SQL script is designed to analyze data related to water quality audits conducted by auditors and employees. Below is an overview of the script's functionality:

- **Database Selection and Data Retrieval:**
  
  The script starts by selecting the database `md_water_services` and retrieving data from the `auditor_report` table.

- **Analysis of Scores and Patterns:**
  
  Initial queries focus on comparing scores and identifying patterns in water quality scores.

- **Joining Tables and Renaming Columns:**
  
  Tables such as `auditor_report`, `visits`, and `water_quality` are joined, and columns are renamed for clarity.

- **Filtering and Data Comparison:**
  
  Data is filtered based on certain conditions, and comparisons are made between auditor and employee scores.

- **Identification of Mistakes:**
  
  Queries are executed to identify records where auditor and employee scores differ, indicating potential mistakes.

- **Analysis of Employee Performance:**
  
  The script calculates the number of mistakes made by each employee and identifies employees with above-average mistakes.

- **Creation of Views:**
  
  Views are created to store and retrieve specific datasets for further analysis.

- **Additional Analysis:**
  
  Further queries are included to filter data based on specific criteria and identify potential issues such as cash-related statements.

- **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
  
  Queries are provided for generating multiple-choice questions based on the analyzed data.

- **Suspect List Generation:**
  
  A list of suspect employees, who have made more mistakes than the average, is generated.

- **Final Data Retrieval:**
  
  The script concludes by retrieving the relevant data, including records with significant score differences and suspicious employee activities.

- **Cleanup:**
  
  Views created during the script execution are dropped to maintain database cleanliness.
