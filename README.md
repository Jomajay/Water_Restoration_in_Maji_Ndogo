# Project: Database Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This project involves querying and analyzing data from two databases: `md_water_services` and `united_nations`. The goal is to derive insights and make informed decisions based on the extracted information. The queries encompass various aspects, including employee data, water sources, service access, and regional statistics.
This SQL script is a comprehensive set of queries and operations performed on databases related to water services and access to basic services. It includes operations such as data manipulation, analysis, and database management. Below is a summary of the key sections of the script:

## Technologies Used
- SQL

## Instructions
1. Connect to the respective databases (`md_water_services`, `united_nations`).
2. Execute the provided SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data.
3. Review the generated insights and draw conclusions for decision-making.

## Queries and Insights
### Water Services Database (`md_water_services`)
- **Employee Information**:
    - Generating new email addresses for employees.
    - Updating employee records with emails and standardized phone numbers.
- **Employee Distribution**:
    - Counting employees per town and identifying top-performing employees.
- **Location Statistics**:
    - Analyzing records per town, province, and location type.
- **Water Source Analysis**:
    - Investigating water sources, people served, and distribution percentages.
- **Ranking and Prioritization**:
    - Ranking water sources based on population served using various methods.

### United Nations Database (`united_nations`)
- **Access to Basic Services**:
    - Reviewing access to managed drinking water services.
    - Analyzing regional and sub-regional statistics, including GDP and country count.

## United Nations Database Operations
- **Basic Services Analysis**: Analyzes access to basic services data, including counts, percentages, and economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment rates.
- **Geographical Location and Economic Indicator Table Creation**: Creates separate tables for geographical location and economic indicators to reduce data redundancy and establish proper relationships.
- **Subqueries and Join Operations**: Demonstrates the use of subqueries and join operations for data analysis and filtering.
  
## Water Services Database Operations
- **Email and Phone Number Formatting**: Formats email addresses and trims unnecessary spaces from phone numbers in the employee table.
- **Employee and Visit Analysis**: Analyzes employee data including counting employees per city and visits per employee.
- **Location and Water Source Analysis**: Provides insights into location data such as record counts per town and province, as well as analysis of water sources including counts and percentages.
- **Employee Ranking**: Ranks employees based on their performance in water source surveys using various ranking functions.
- **Queue Analysis**: Utilizes datetime functions to analyze survey duration, most visited day of the week, and average time spent in queues during surveys.

## Additional Features
- **Data Type Conversion**: Demonstrates data type conversion functions such as CAST() and CONVERT().
- **String Manipulation**: Utilizes string manipulation functions for data cleaning and extraction.
- **Custom ID Generation**: Generates custom IDs for countries based on specified columns in the table.
- **Regional Classification**: Classifies African countries into regional economic communities and performs analysis based on this classification.
- **Subquery Operations**: Utilizes subqueries for data filtering and analysis, both with JOIN and FROM keywords.
